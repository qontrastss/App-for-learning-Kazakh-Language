# Readme File for Educational App for Learning Kazakh Language with Firebase Backend

This project is an educational app designed to help users learn the Kazakh language using Flutter, with a Dart-based backend connected to Firebase. The app provides various features and tools for users to improve their language skills through interactive exercises, games, and quizzes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to have Flutter installed on your machine, as well as access to a Firebase project. You can download and install Flutter by following the instructions on the Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Once you have installed Flutter and set up a Firebase project, you can clone the repository for this project using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/qontrastss/App-for-learning-Kazakh-Language.git
  
  
After cloning the repository, you will need to configure your Firebase project credentials by adding them to the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.

You will also need to configure the backend by updating the Firebase services in the `lib/backend/firebase_service.dart` file to match your own Firebase project.

Once you have configured the backend and Firebase project, you can open the app in your preferred IDE or text editor and run the app using the following command:

flutter run
  
  
This will launch the app on an emulator or physical device.
